Creation of master DB

///
Some Variables are Linked (!)

RTC should not be stored

ALL LCD Values are shared
(except maybe mood lighting - currently lcd only controls one set, but two will be installed: will they be individually controlled?)

General - Unique?

ALL EC Values are unique
///


TO DO -

Manage EC - Simplest to do.

One EC - Saloon
One EC - Bedroom

Read all variables and store in DB.

on poll, if value has changed, add to queue/process now (benefits of each?)
